	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient because it can process larger inputs faster.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run relative to the input size. Efficient algorithms aim for low <b>Space Complexity</b>, such as O(n), to minimize memory usage.</p>
