	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes with input size. Selecting algorithms with better time complexity leads to more efficient performance.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential when working with limited memory. A common example is O(n).</p>
