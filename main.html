	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. A lower time complexity often means the algorithm is more <strong>efficient</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Space Complexity</strong> measures the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm during its execution. It is typically expressed in terms of Big O notation, such as O(n).
