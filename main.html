	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity refers to how the computation time of an algorithm increases with input size. It is essential for analyzing how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity.
    </p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size. It is commonly expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which describes how the space required grows with the input.
