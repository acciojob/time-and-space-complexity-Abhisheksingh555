  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It is a crucial concept in computer science used to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity and perform better with larger inputs.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It helps developers understand how scalable their code is. The notation O(n) is often used to express space complexity, where 'n' represents the input size.
